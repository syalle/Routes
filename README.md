# Routes
The goal of this project is to create a JavaFX application for an automated bus booking system. The system will manage a database of available routes, including source and destination cities, departure and arrival times, available seats, and ticket prices.

Key functionalities include:

Displaying all routes sorted by departure city and time, using Java streams.
Allowing users to select a source city from a combo box, which updates the destination options accordingly.
Showing available routes based on user-selected source and destination cities, including details such as time, duration, and price.
Enabling users to book tickets, update seat availability, display total price, and notify them if tickets are unavailable.
This project integrates JavaFX for the GUI, Java streams for efficient data processing, and a relational database for data storage, ensuring a smooth and dynamic user experience.
